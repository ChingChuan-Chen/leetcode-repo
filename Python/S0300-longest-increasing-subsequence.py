"""
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 

Note: 

	There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
	Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

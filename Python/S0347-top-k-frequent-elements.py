"""
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

Note: 

	You may assume k is always valid, 1 &le; k &le; number of unique elements.
	Your algorithm&#39;s time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array&#39;s size.
	It&#39;s guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
	You can return the answer in any order.

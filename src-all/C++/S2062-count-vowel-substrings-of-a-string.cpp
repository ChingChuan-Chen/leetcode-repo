/*
A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') and has all five vowels present in it.

Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.

 
Example 1:
Input: word = "aeiouu"
Output: 2
Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
- "aeiouu"
- "aeiouu"

Example 2:
Input: word = "unicornarihan"
Output: 0
Explanation: Not all 5 vowels are present, so there are no vowel substrings.

Example 3:
Input: word = "cuaieuouac"
Output: 7
Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"

 
Constraints:
	1 <= word.length <= 100
	word consists of lowercase English letters only.

/*
Given two integers A and B, return any string S such that:

	S has length A + B and contains exactly A &#39;a&#39; letters, and exactly B &#39;b&#39; letters;
	The substring &#39;aaa&#39; does not occur in S;
	The substring &#39;bbb&#39; does not occur in S.

 

Example 1:
Input: A = 1, B = 2
Output: "abb"
Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.

Example 2:
Input: A = 4, B = 1
Output: "aabaa"

 

Note:
	0 <= A <= 100
	0 <= B <= 100
	It is guaranteed such an S exists for the given A and B.

/*
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

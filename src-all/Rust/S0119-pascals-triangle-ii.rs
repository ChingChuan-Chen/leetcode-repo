/*
Given a non-negative index k where k &le; 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal&#39;s triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

In Pascal&#39;s triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:

Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]

Follow up:
Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

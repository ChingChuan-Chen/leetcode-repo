/*
Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

	All letters in this word are capitals, like &quot;USA&quot;.
	All letters in this word are not capitals, like &quot;leetcode&quot;.
	Only the first letter in this word is capital, like &quot;Google&quot;.

Otherwise, we define that this word doesn&#39;t use capitals in a right way.

 

Example 1:
Input: &quot;USA&quot;
Output: True

 

Example 2:
Input: &quot;FlaG&quot;
Output: False

 

Note: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.

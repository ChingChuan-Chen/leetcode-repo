/*
Given a 2D grid of 0s and 1s, return the number of elements in the largest square subgrid that has all 1s on its border, or 0 if such a subgrid doesn&#39;t exist in the grid.

 
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 9

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:
	1 <= grid.length <= 100
	1 <= grid[0].length <= 100
	grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

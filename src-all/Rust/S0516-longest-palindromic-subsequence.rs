/*
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence&#39;s length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input:

"bbbab"

Output:

4

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

 

Example 2:
Input:

"cbbd"

Output:

2

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
 
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s consists only of lowercase English letters.

/*
You&#39;re given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so &quot;a&quot; is considered a different type of stone from &quot;A&quot;.

Example 1:
Input: J = &quot;aA&quot;, S = &quot;aAAbbbb&quot;
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: J = &quot;z&quot;, S = &quot;ZZ&quot;
Output: 0

Note:
	S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
	The characters in J are distinct.

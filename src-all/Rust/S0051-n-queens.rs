/*
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n&times;n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens&#39; placement, where &#39;Q&#39; and &#39;.&#39; both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

Example:

Input: 4
Output: [
 [&quot;.Q..&quot;,  // Solution 1
  &quot;...Q&quot;,
  &quot;Q...&quot;,
  &quot;..Q.&quot;],

 [&quot;..Q.&quot;,  // Solution 2
  &quot;Q...&quot;,
  &quot;...Q&quot;,
  &quot;.Q..&quot;]
]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.

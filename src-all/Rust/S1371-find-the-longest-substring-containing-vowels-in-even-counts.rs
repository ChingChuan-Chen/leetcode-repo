/*
Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, and &#39;u&#39; must appear an even number of times.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains two each of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.

Example 2:
Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains two e&#39;s.

Example 3:
Input: s = "bcbcbc"
Output: 6
Explanation: In this case, the given string "bcbcbc" is the longest because all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.

 
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5
	s contains only lowercase English letters.

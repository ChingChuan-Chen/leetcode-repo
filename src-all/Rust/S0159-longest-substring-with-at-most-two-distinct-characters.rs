/*
Given a string s , find the length of the longest substring t  that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: &quot;eceba&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: t is &quot;ece&quot; which its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: &quot;ccaabbb&quot;
Output: 5
Explanation: t is &quot;aabbb&quot; which its length is 5.

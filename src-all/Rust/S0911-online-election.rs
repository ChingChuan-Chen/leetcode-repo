/*
In an election, the i-th vote was cast for persons[i] at time times[i].

Now, we would like to implement the following query function: TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) will return the number of the person that was leading the election at time t.  

Votes cast at time t will count towards our query.  In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

 

Example 1:
Input: [&quot;TopVotedCandidate&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;q&quot;,&quot;q&quot;], [[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30]],[3],[12],[25],[15],[24],[8]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,0,0,1]
Explanation: 
At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
This continues for 3 more queries at time 15, 24, and 8.

 

Note:
	1 <= persons.length = times.length <= 5000
	0 <= persons[i] <= persons.length
	times is a strictly increasing array with all elements in [0, 10^9].
	TopVotedCandidate.q is called at most 10000 times per test case.
	TopVotedCandidate.q(int t) is always called with t >= times[0].

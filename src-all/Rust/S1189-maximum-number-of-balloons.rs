/*
Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word &quot;balloon&quot; as possible.

You can use each character in text at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

 
Example 1:
Input: text = &quot;nlaebolko&quot;
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: text = &quot;loonbalxballpoon&quot;
Output: 2

Input: text = &quot;leetcode&quot;
Output: 0

 
Constraints:
	1 <= text.length <= 10^4
	text consists of lower case English letters only.

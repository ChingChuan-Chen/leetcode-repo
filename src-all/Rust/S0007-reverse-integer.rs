/*
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:
Input: 123
Output: 321

Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321

Example 3:
Input: 120
Output: 21

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [&minus;231,  231 &minus; 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

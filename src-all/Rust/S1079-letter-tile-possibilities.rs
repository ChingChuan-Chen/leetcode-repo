/*
You have n  tiles, where each tile has one letter tiles[i] printed on it.

Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make using the letters printed on those tiles.

 
Example 1:
Input: tiles = &quot;AAB&quot;
Output: 8
Explanation: The possible sequences are &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;BA&quot;, &quot;AAB&quot;, &quot;ABA&quot;, &quot;BAA&quot;.

Example 2:
Input: tiles = &quot;AAABBC&quot;
Output: 188

Input: tiles = &quot;V&quot;
Output: 1

 
Constraints:
	1 <= tiles.length <= 7

/*
Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = &quot;leetcode&quot;
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring &quot;ee&quot; is of length 2 with the character &#39;e&#39; only.

Example 2:
Input: s = &quot;abbcccddddeeeeedcba&quot;
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring &quot;eeeee&quot; is of length 5 with the character &#39;e&#39; only.

Example 3:
Input: s = &quot;triplepillooooow&quot;
Output: 5

Example 4:
Input: s = &quot;hooraaaaaaaaaaay&quot;
Output: 11

Example 5:
Input: s = &quot;tourist&quot;
Output: 1

 
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 500
	s contains only lowercase English letters.

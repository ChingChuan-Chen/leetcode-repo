/*
Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character &#39;e&#39; only.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character &#39;e&#39; only.

Example 3:
Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5

Example 4:
Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
Output: 11

Example 5:
Input: s = "tourist"
Output: 1

 
Constraints:
	1 <= s.length <= 500
	s contains only lowercase English letters.

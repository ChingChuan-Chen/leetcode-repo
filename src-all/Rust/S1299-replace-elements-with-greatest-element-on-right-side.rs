/*
Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with -1.

After doing so, return the array.

 
Example 1:
Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]

 
Constraints:
	1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
	1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

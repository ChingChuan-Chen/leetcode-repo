/*
Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.

 
Example 1:
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.

 
Constraints:
	1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000
	1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000

/*
You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive &quot;++&quot; into &quot;--&quot;. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

Example:

Input: s = &quot;++++&quot;
Output: true 
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle &quot;++&quot; to become &quot;+--+&quot;.

Follow up:
Derive your algorithm&#39;s runtime complexity.

/*
Given a string s, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

Example 1:
Input: &quot;aacecaaa&quot;
Output: &quot;aaacecaaa&quot;

Example 2:
Input: &quot;abcd&quot;
Output: &quot;dcbabcd&quot;

/*

Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

Note:
	All numbers will be positive integers.
	The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:
Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]

Example 2:
Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]

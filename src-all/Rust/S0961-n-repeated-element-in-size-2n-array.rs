/*
In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.

Return the element repeated N times.

 

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: [2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5

 

Note:
	4 <= A.length <= 10000
	0 <= A[i] < 10000
	A.length is even

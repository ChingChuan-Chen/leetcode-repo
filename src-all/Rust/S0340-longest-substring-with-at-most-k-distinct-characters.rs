/*
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = &quot;eceba&quot;, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is &quot;ece&quot; which its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = &quot;aa&quot;, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is &quot;aa&quot; which its length is 2.

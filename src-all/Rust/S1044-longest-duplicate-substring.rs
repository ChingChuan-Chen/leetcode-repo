/*
Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is &quot;&quot;.)

 

Example 1:
Input: &quot;banana&quot;
Output: &quot;ana&quot;

Example 2:
Input: &quot;abcd&quot;
Output: &quot;&quot;

 

Note:
	2 <= S.length <= 10^5
	S consists of lowercase English letters.

/*
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: &quot;abcabcbb&quot;
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is &quot;abc&quot;, with the length of 3. 

Example 2:
Input: &quot;bbbbb&quot;
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is &quot;b&quot;, with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: &quot;pwwkew&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is &quot;wke&quot;, with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, &quot;pwke&quot; is a subsequence and not a substring.

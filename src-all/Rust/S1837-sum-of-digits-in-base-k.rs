/*
Given an integer n (in base 10) and a base k, return the sum of the digits of n after converting n from base 10 to base k.

After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base 10 number, and the sum should be returned in base 10.

 
Example 1:
Input: n = 34, k = 6
Output: 9
Explanation: 34 (base 10) expressed in base 6 is 54. 5 + 4 = 9.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10, k = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: n is already in base 10. 1 + 0 = 1.

 
Constraints:
	1 <= n <= 100
	2 <= k <= 10

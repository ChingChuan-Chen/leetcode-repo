/*
Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1. 

Example 1:
Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 2:
Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Note:
The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

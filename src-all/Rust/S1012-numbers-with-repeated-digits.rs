/*
Given a positive integer N, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to N that have at least 1 repeated digit.

 

Example 1:
Input: 20
Output: 1
Explanation: The only positive number (<= 20) with at least 1 repeated digit is 11.

Example 2:
Input: 100
Output: 10
Explanation: The positive numbers (<= 100) with atleast 1 repeated digit are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, and 100.

Example 3:
Input: 1000
Output: 262

 

Note:
	1 <= N <= 10^9

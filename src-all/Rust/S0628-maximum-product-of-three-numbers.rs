/*
Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6

 

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24

 

Note:
	The length of the given array will be in range [3,104] and all elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].
	Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won&#39;t exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.

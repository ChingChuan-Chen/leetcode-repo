/*
Given an array consists of non-negative integers,  your task is to count the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

Example 1:
Input: [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3

Note:
The length of the given array won't exceed 1000.
The integers in the given array are in the range of [0, 1000].

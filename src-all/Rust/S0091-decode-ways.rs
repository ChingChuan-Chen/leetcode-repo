/*
A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

&#39;A&#39; -> 1
&#39;B&#39; -> 2
...
&#39;Z&#39; -> 26

Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

Example 1:
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

Example 2:
Input: "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).

/*
Given a palindromic string palindrome, replace exactly one character by any lowercase English letter so that the string becomes the lexicographically smallest possible string that isn&#39;t a palindrome.

After doing so, return the final string.  If there is no way to do so, return the empty string.

 
Example 1:
Input: palindrome = "abccba"
Output: "aaccba"

Example 2:
Input: palindrome = "a"
Output: ""

 
Constraints:
	1 <= palindrome.length <= 1000
	palindrome consists of only lowercase English letters.

"""
Given the array favoriteCompanies where favoriteCompanies[i] is the list of favorites companies for the ith person (indexed from 0).

Return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list of favorites companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.

 
Example 1:
Input: favoriteCompanies = [[&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;],[&quot;google&quot;,&quot;microsoft&quot;],[&quot;google&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;],[&quot;google&quot;],[&quot;amazon&quot;]]
Output: [0,1,4] 
Explanation: 
Person with index=2 has favoriteCompanies[2]=[&quot;google&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=[&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;] corresponding to the person with index 0. 
Person with index=3 has favoriteCompanies[3]=[&quot;google&quot;] which is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=[&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;] and favoriteCompanies[1]=[&quot;google&quot;,&quot;microsoft&quot;]. 
Other lists of favorite companies are not a subset of another list, therefore, the answer is [0,1,4].

Example 2:
Input: favoriteCompanies = [[&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;],[&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;amazon&quot;],[&quot;facebook&quot;,&quot;google&quot;]]
Output: [0,1] 
Explanation: In this case favoriteCompanies[2]=[&quot;facebook&quot;,&quot;google&quot;] is a subset of favoriteCompanies[0]=[&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;google&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;], therefore, the answer is [0,1].

Example 3:
Input: favoriteCompanies = [[&quot;leetcode&quot;],[&quot;google&quot;],[&quot;facebook&quot;],[&quot;amazon&quot;]]
Output: [0,1,2,3]

 
Constraints:
	1 <= favoriteCompanies.length <= 100
	1 <= favoriteCompanies[i].length <= 500
	1 <= favoriteCompanies[i][j].length <= 20
	All strings in favoriteCompanies[i] are distinct.
	All lists of favorite companies are distinct, that is, If we sort alphabetically each list then favoriteCompanies[i] != favoriteCompanies[j].
	All strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

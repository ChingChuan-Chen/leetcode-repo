"""
Given a binary tree, find the largest subtree which is a Binary Search Tree (BST), where largest means subtree with largest number of nodes in it.

Note:
A subtree must include all of its descendants.

Example:

Input: [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]

   10 
   / \ 
  5  15 
 / \   \ 
1   8   7

Output: 3
Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one.
             The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.

Follow up:
Can you figure out ways to solve it with O(n) time complexity?

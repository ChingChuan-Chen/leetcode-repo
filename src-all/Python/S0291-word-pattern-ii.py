"""
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.

 
Example 1:
Input: pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue"
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd"
Output: true
Example 3:
Input: pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc"
Output: false

 
Constraints:
	You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.

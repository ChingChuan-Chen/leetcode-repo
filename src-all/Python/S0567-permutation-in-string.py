"""
Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string&#39;s permutations is the substring of the second string.

 

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: True
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Example 2:
Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: False

 
Constraints:
	The input strings only contain lower case letters.
	The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].

"""
Given a string S, count the number of distinct, non-empty subsequences of S .

Since the result may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:
Input: &quot;abc&quot;
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;bc&quot;, and &quot;abc&quot;.

Example 2:
Input: &quot;aba&quot;
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;aa&quot; and &quot;aba&quot;.

Example 3:
Input: &quot;aaa&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;aa&quot; and &quot;aaa&quot;.

 

 

Note:
	S contains only lowercase letters.
	1 <= S.length <= 2000

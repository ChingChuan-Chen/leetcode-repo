"""
Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Example:

Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
Output: 45

Note:
Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.

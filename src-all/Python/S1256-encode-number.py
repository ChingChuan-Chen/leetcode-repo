"""
Given a non-negative integer num, Return its encoding string.

The encoding is done by converting the integer to a string using a secret function that you should deduce from the following table:

 
Example 1:
Input: num = 23
Output: &quot;1000&quot;

Example 2:
Input: num = 107
Output: &quot;101100&quot;

 
Constraints:
	0 <= num <= 10^9

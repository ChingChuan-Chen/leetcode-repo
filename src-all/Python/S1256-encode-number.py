"""
Given a non-negative integer num, Return its encoding string.

The encoding is done by converting the integer to a string using a secret function that you should deduce from the following table:

 
Example 1:
Input: num = 23
Output: "1000"

Example 2:
Input: num = 107
Output: "101100"

 
Constraints:
	0 <= num <= 10^9

class Solution:
    def encode(self, num: int) -> str:
        
        pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    assert Solution().encode(0) == 0

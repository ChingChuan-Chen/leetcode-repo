"""
Given the head of a linked list and two integers m and n. Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:

	Start with the head as the current node.
	Keep the first m nodes starting with the current node.
	Remove the next n nodes
	Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.

Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.

Follow up question: How can you solve this problem by modifying the list in-place?

 
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], m = 2, n = 3
Output: [1,2,6,7,11,12]
Explanation: Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the linked List  (1 ->2) show in black nodes.
Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -> 4 -> 5) show in read nodes.
Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List.
Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [1,5,9]
Explanation: Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 3, n = 1
Output: [1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11]

Example 4:
Input: head = [9,3,7,7,9,10,8,2], m = 1, n = 2
Output: [9,7,8]

 
Constraints:
	The given linked list will contain between 1 and 10^4 nodes.
	The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range [1, 10^6].
	1 <= m,n <= 1000

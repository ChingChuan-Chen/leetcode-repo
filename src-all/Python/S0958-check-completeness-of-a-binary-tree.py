"""
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn&#39;t as far left as possible.

 

Note:
	The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

"""
Given a string S, find out the length of the longest repeating substring(s). Return 0 if no repeating substring exists.

 

Example 1:
Input: &quot;abcd&quot;
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no repeating substring.

Example 2:
Input: &quot;abbaba&quot;
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest repeating substrings are &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;ba&quot;, each of which occurs twice.

Example 3:
Input: &quot;aabcaabdaab&quot;
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is &quot;aab&quot;, which occurs 3 times.

Example 4:
Input: &quot;aaaaa&quot;
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is &quot;aaaa&quot;, which occurs twice.

 
Constraints:
	The string S consists of only lowercase English letters from &#39;a&#39; - &#39;z&#39;.
	1 <= S.length <= 1500

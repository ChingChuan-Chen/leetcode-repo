"""
Given a string S, find out the length of the longest repeating substring(s). Return 0 if no repeating substring exists.

 

Example 1:
Input: "abcd"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no repeating substring.

Example 2:
Input: "abbaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest repeating substrings are "ab" and "ba", each of which occurs twice.

Example 3:
Input: "aabcaabdaab"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aab", which occurs 3 times.

Example 4:
Input: "aaaaa"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aaaa", which occurs twice.

 
Constraints:
	The string S consists of only lowercase English letters from 'a' - 'z'.
	1 <= S.length <= 1500

"""
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

Example 1:
Input: a = &quot;11&quot;, b = &quot;1&quot;
Output: &quot;100&quot;

Example 2:
Input: a = &quot;1010&quot;, b = &quot;1011&quot;
Output: &quot;10101&quot;

 
Constraints:
	Each string consists only of &#39;0&#39; or &#39;1&#39; characters.
	1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4
	Each string is either &quot;0&quot; or doesn&#39;t contain any leading zero.

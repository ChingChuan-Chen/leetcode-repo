"""
Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level X such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level X is maximal.

 

Example 1:
Input: [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

 

Note:
	The number of nodes in the given tree is between 1 and 10^4.
	-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5
